    \section{Introduction}
    This is the first booklet in the documentation of Lefty Framework, which covers the documentation for LAMENT.
    LAMENT is the reference implementation of Sacramentum's Configuration Theory. Configuration theory describes
    how a computer system is configured and how this configuration can be applied to fleets of machines in a
    uniform way. It builds upon the ideas presented in Eelco Dolstra's thesis \textbf{\textit{The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model}} and
    makes them more accessible to the end users.

    \textit{Configuration Theory} presents us how computer systems are configured, how changes are applied, and more importantly,
    \textit{how declarative and immutable configuration can live together with plain old mutable configuration}.
